Follow the [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkGugQ019ZY) or read the manual below.

### Make sure your device is compatible

0. Are you sure you're actually using a Huawei/Honor device?
1. Open the Settings â†’ About phone. Check the CPU: it should be _**HiSilicon Kirin** \*\*\*_. If it is not your case (MediaTek, Qualcomm), then alas, your device is not supported. :(
2. Okay, now you know CPU model. It should be one of these modification:
    - Kirin 620
    - Kirin 650
    - Kirin 655
    - Kirin 658
    - Kirin 659
    - Kirin 925
    - Kirin 935
    - Kirin 950
    - Kirin 960
3. **100% incompatible CPUs with PotatoNV: Kirin 710, 710A, 710F, 810, 970, 980, 985, 990 & newer.**
4. As for Kirin 710, 710F, 970 & 980, there is an alternative **paid** option â€” [see the "Alternatives" section below](#alternatives).

### Getting inside

The first step is the most difficult thing to do. You need to disassemble your device: this is necessary in order to access the contacts on the motherboard.

If you're not sure that you have enough experience to disassemble the device, then consider using paid software, that supports _"software testpoint"_.

> **Warning**
>
> I strongly recommend watching video manuals for disassembling your device.

> **Warning**
>
> **Be extremely careful with planar cables!**
>
> These cables are used in tablets, as well as in phones with a fingerprint scanner on the back cover.

You will need: a hair dryer, a guitar pick or a plastic card, conductive tweezers and maybe a screwdriver.

1. Turn off the device.
2. Heat the back cover evenly with a hair dryer.
3. After a couple of minutes, try to stick the plastic card into the corner between case and lid, try to lift the edge and then deepen the card.
4. Move around the perimeter of the back cover, peeling off glue.
5. Now you can remove the back cover.

### Entering download mode

It's time to Google. You need to find the location of a special point on the motherboard â€“ testpoint.

> **Note**
>
> If you are wondering why you need to do something with the unfortunate testpoint, then read [the contents of the spoiler below](#how-it-works).

To search, use the model name before the hyphen + "testpoint".
For example for Honor 9 Lite (LLD-L31) you should Google ["lld testpoint"](https://www.google.com/search?q=lld+testpoint&tbm=isch).

<details>
<summary>An example how a typical testpoint photo looks like.</summary>

![Honor 9 Lite Testpoint location](https://i.imgur.com/233Kn27.jpg)
</details>

The marks may vary:

1. Only one point is marked in the photo.
2. In the photo, a line is drawn between the point and the metal shield.
3. In the photo, a line is drawn between two points.

Here you will need sleight of hand: try to short-circuit the point and the metal shield (in option 1 and 2), or short-circuit both points (option 3) with tweezers.
Without removing the tweezers, connect the USB cable to the computer.

After 3 seconds, the tweezers can be removed.

Open the "Device Manager" â€“ you should see an unknown device named `USB SER`, or Serial Port `HUAWEI USB COM 1.0`.

If the device has not been detected, make sure you are using a good cable, the tweezers are not a dielectric, and you are shorting the desired point.

### Unlocking the bootloader

- Install [HiSuite](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/hisuite/).
- Install [Huawei Testpoint Drivers](https://files.dc-unlocker.com/share.html?v=share/18B15B9D02C945A79B1967234CECB423).
- Download [the latest release](https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV/releases) of PotatoNV.
- Start PotatoNV.

> **Note**
>
> All bootloaders are flashing to RAM, so an incorrect bootloader cannot harm the device.

> **Note**
>
> `Disable FBLOCK` checkbox disables a special security check.
> That modification allows you to flash/erase secure partitions or execute oem commands,
> that are not available with normal unlocking by unlock code \[`USERLOCK`].

> **Warning**
>
> `FBLOCK` unlocking works correctly only on devices with Kirin 960 or Kirin 65x.
> Disabling this option can cause serious problems on legacy devices.

Okay, now refer to [this table](#tested-devices) and select the appropriate bootloader.

Press the Start button. ðŸª„

The procedure will take no more than a minute.
The program should write a new unlock code, keep it in a safe place.

Reboot your device to fastboot mode and execute following command on the host machine:

```shell
fastboot oem unlock YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

have fun.
<!-- right, anti? :) -->

## How it works

<details>

Even before creating PotatoNV, [@TishSerg](https://github.com/TishSerg) discovered that unlock key can be rewritten with the **SHA256 hash** of the desired key to the `USRKEY` property. However, to access **_NVME_** _(a raw partition that stores stuff like serial number, device traits, etc.)_, a user should flash _custom_ recovery or gain temporary root privileges. But both methods are complex and are not guaranteed to work. After researching the legacy bootloader of some Huawei devices, I've found a `nve` command, which allows to read or write any property in the **_NVME_** partition. Of course, this command requires an unlocked bootloader.
So it remains to find a way to quickly unlock the bootloader. The way out is quite simple - use the bootloader from the board software.

The program uploads a special **_"USB bootloader"_** _(exported from the board software)_ through the `DOWNLOAD_VCOM` mode. **_VCOM_** is smth like **_EDL_** on Qualcomm devices: it can be triggered by a system failure or by **shorting testpoint**.
After uploading the bootloader, the device should switch to the fastboot mode. The "USB bootloader" has an important trait: it's **unlocked out-of-the-box**, so it allows to execute any command.

So, we're just going to send a command through the USB bulk interface to write SHA256 hash to USRKEY and reboot the device.

That's it.

## Alternatives

#### HCU Client

As far as I know, there is currently only one tool that can deal with newer CPUs â€” HCU Client.

This software requires a license, the most affordable plan is 3 days of access for â‚¬19.

See supported models by HCU Client [here](https://hcu-client.com/supported-models.php).

> **Note**
> 
> [Timed licenses locked to first used PC](https://hcu-client.com/buy/#:~:text=Timed%20licenses%20locked%20to%20first%20used%20PC) for two days.
> Therefore, it would be problematic to use such a license on more than one phone.
