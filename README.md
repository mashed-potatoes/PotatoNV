## How it works (in a nutshell)

Even before creating PotatoNV, [@TishSerg](https://github.com/TishSerg) discovered that unlock key can be rewritten with the **SHA256 hash** of the desired key to the `USRKEY` property. However, to access **_NVME_** _(a raw partition that stores stuff like serial number, device traits, etc.)_, a user should flash _custom_ recovery or gain temporary root privileges. But both methods are complex and are not guaranteed to work. After researching the legacy bootloader of some Huawei devices, I've found a `nve` command, which allows to read or write any property in the **_NVME_** partition. Of course, this command requires an unlocked bootloader.
So it remains to find a way to quickly unlock the bootloader. The way out is quite simple - use the bootloader from the board software.

The program uploads a special **_"USB bootloader"_** _(exported from the board software)_ through the `DOWNLOAD_VCOM` mode. **_VCOM_** is smth like **_EDL_** on Qualcomm devices: it can be triggered by a system failure or by **shorting testpoint**.
After uploading the bootloader, the device should switch to the fastboot mode. The "USB bootloader" has an important trait: it's **unlocked out-of-the-box**, so it allows to execute any command.

So, we're just going to send a command through the USB bulk interface to write SHA256 hash to USRKEY and reboot the device.

That's it.
